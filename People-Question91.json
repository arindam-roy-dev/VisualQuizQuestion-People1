"aboutAnswer":"Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.\nNoodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are also often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material composition and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of noodles. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures.\nWheat noodles are produced mainly from flour, water and salt, and the basic steps of noodles production include dough mixing, sheeting, combining of sheets, resting, rolling and cutting, followed by different processing treatments (drying, boiling, steaming, frying and freezing) or a combination of these.\nThe origin of thin, string-like pieces of dough that are often dried and then cooked is hard to pinpoint. What is called noodles is sometimes only considered to be the modern East Asian variety and not the general type and correspondingly its origin is usually listed as Chinese, but when it includes pasta it becomes more controversial. The earliest written record of noodles in China is found in a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE). It became a staple food for the people of the Han dynasty.\nFood historians generally estimate that pasta\'s origin is from among the Mediterranean countries."
