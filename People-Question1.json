"aboutAnswer":"It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. The violin typically has four strings. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition. \nThe violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola."
