"aboutAnswer":"The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr led the band to be regarded as the foremost and most influential in history.\nWith a sound rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the group were integral to the evolution of pop music into an art form, and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market, and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their motion-picture debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (also known as the \"White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969)"
