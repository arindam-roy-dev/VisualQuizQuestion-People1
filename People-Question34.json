"aboutAnswer":"Advent Sunday, also called the First Sunday of Advent or First Advent Sunday, among the Western Christian Churches, is the first day of the liturgical year and the start of the season of Advent.\nAdvent Sunday is the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day. This is equivalent to the Sunday nearest to St. Andrew\'s Day, 30 November, and the Sunday following the Feast of Christ the King. It can fall on any date between 27 November and 3 December.\nWhen Christmas Day is a Monday, Advent Sunday will fall on its latest possible date. It is possible to compute the date of Advent Sunday by adding three days to the date of the last Thursday of November; it can also be computed as the Sunday before the first Thursday of December."
