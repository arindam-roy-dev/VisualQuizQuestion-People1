"aboutAnswer":"Pickman\'s Model is a short story by H. P. Lovecraft, written in September 1926 and first published in the October 1927 issue of Weird Tales. It was adapted for television in a 1971 episode of the Night Gallery anthology series, starring Bradford Dillman.\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 – March 15, 1937) was an American writer of weird fiction and horror fiction.\nBorn in Providence, Rhode Island, he spent most of his life there, and his fiction was primarily set against a New England backdrop. Lovecraft was never able to support himself from earnings as an author and editor, and he subsisted in progressively strained circumstances in his last years. He died of cancer at the age of 46.\nLovecraft was virtually unknown during his lifetime and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, but is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors of weird and horror fiction.\nAmong his most celebrated tales are \"The Call of Cthulhu\", \"The Rats in the Walls\", At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out of Time.\nHis writings were the basis of the Cthulhu Mythos, which has inspired a large body of pastiches, games, music and other media drawing on Lovecraft\'s characters, setting and themes, constituting a wider body of work known as Lovecraftian horror."
