"aboutAnswer":"Poutine is a dish that includes french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It originated in the Canadian province of Quebec and emerged in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec area.\nFor many years, it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec society.\nPoutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois cultural pride. Its rise in prominence led to its popularity outside the province, especially in Ontario and in the Northeastern United States."
